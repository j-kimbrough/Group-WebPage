        <h2>Our Story!</h2>
        <p>Lava Java is a startup shop founded by coffee enthusiast who wants to bring their passion to the community. Our mission is to help save the environment while doing what we love and serve beautiful cups of coffee.

On top of having delicious coffee, we also serve bake goods with ingredients founded from our local partners in the Pacific Northwest. 

We are proud to bring recipes that were passed down from our grandmother, serving fresh flakey croissants, thinly layered cakes, and many other baked goods and treats for all our consumers. 

Lava Java aims to bring a new wind to Seattleâ€™s coffee community and make it more diverse, exclusive, and interesting.</p>
